# mychisel

A chisel that allows you to shape blocks.

To craft a chisel just put a steel ingot and a brown wool in the crafting grid. The steel goes above the wool.

Once you have your chisel you can set the style by right clicking. 

There are 5 styles to choose from
- horizontal groove
- vertical groove
- cross groves (this matches up with the vertical and horizontal grooves
- square
- 4 edges

Right click until you see the style you want in the chat then point at the node and left click.
Each node can be cut 4 times. Each time you chisel the groove will get a little deeper.

Only certain nodes can be chiseled. Here are the supported nodes


	Cobble
	Sandstone
	Clay
	Coal Block
	Stone
	Desert Stone"
	Wood
	Acacia Wood
	Aspen Wood
	Pine Wood
	Desert Cobble
	Jungle Wood
	Sandstone Brick
	Stone Brick
	Desert Stone Brick
